								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>My name is Indra Kurniawan, a Mechanical Engineer with an interest in Mobile Robots and all things robotics. To further explore the field of robotics and gain valuable experience, I have done an internship developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) and am currently working on an Autonomous Sweeper as my Final Year Project (FYP).</p>

								<p>I am also part of the NUS Rover team and we will be taking part in the University Rover Challenge 2021.</p>
								<hr />

								<h3>Interests</h3>
								<p>Apart from hardware development, I am also interested in developing the software-side of AV such as path planning, control and sensor fusion algorithms. I have done numerous courses online to understand these algorithms better and read articles on their implementation.</p>
								<hr />

								<h3>Robotics Experience</h3>
								<h4>NUS Advanced Robotics Center</h4>
								<p>I am currently working on a year-long project with NUS Advanced Robotics Centre (NUS ARC) to develop the software stack for the Autonomous Sweeper. Its main task is to perform various cleaning processes from point to point. The Sweeper is an adaptation of Karcherâ€™s Industrial Cleaning Robot which requires a human operator. To make it autonomous, we are working on changing it to a drive-by-wire system and using ROS to implement the Autonomous Stack. There are various sensors installed on the sweeper to enable autonomous driving (AD) and most of the development and initial testing is done in Gazebo. We are also planning to conduct trials at NUS University Town in the future to test its AD capabilities.</p>

								<h4>Siemens Mobility</h4>
								<p>My recent internship at Siemens Mobility was the turning point of my student life as it made me develop an interest in Robotics. I was tasked to improve the mechanical systems of the drive-by-wire vehicle allowing me to understand the entire system better. I was also given the responsibility of managing the sensor network installed at the Centre of Excellence for Testing and Research of Autonomous Vehicles NTU (CETRAN). This includes installing, maintaining and troubleshooting any problems that occurred with the sensor network installed on road infrastructures. The highlight of my internship was the Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress 2019 (ITS WC) where I was part of the Siemens team showcasing our product to potential customers through a series of use-case demonstrations.</p>
